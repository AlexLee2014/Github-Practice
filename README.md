TODO:   
1. How to contribute  
2. Figure out what else TODO  

# Pulling the Code

 1. [Set up and configure][1] your Eclipse and FRC tools installation.

 2. Download and install [git][3] for your system.

 3. On Linux-based and Mac OS X systems, open up a terminal; on Windows, find "Git Bash" in
    the Start Menu and open it up.

 4. You'll start out in your home directory. You'll need to switch over to your
    “workspace” directory, which is usually in your "Documents" folder.
    Run the following command inside your console window:

        cd Documents/workspace
 
 5. Pull down a copy of this repository by running the following commands:

        git clone git@github.com:frc604/FRC-2015.git
        cd FRC-2015/
        git submodule init
        git submodule update
        cd ..
        mv FRC-2015 2015
